Approximately 25 miles (40 km) long, it connects the city of Seattle to the northeastern suburbs of Kenmore, Bothell, Woodinville, and Monroe. Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of Lake Washington; the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area's major highways, including Interstate 5, Interstate 405, SR 9, and U.S. Route 2. The present day route of SR 522 was built in stages between 1907 and 1965, beginning with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, then part of the Pacific Highway and later U.S. Route 99. Since the late 1990s, the SR 522 corridor between Woodinville and Monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population. (Full article...)

The subject of this portrait is believed to be Anne Lovell, wife of Sir Francis Lovell (d. 1551), an esquire of the body to Henry VIII. The evidence for this was uncovered by stained-glass historian David J. King while studying the windows of the church in East Harling, Norfolk, the Lovell family's seat. King noted the Lovell family's coat of arms alongside squirrels in the stained glass, and also that the starlings in the painting are a pun on the name of the village.
